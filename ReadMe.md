# Drag-and-Drop Image Grid

This is a web project that allows users to drag and drop images within a 5x5 grid. The project is designed with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it includes features to highlight empty cells when an image is dragged over them, making it easy to see where images can be placed.

## Features

- **5x5 Grid Layout**: A grid with 25 cells, allowing up to 25 images to be placed.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Images can be freely moved within the grid, either to empty cells or swapped with images in other cells.
- **Highlight Empty Cells**: When dragging an image, empty cells are highlighted to indicate valid drop zones.
- **Image Swapping**: If an image is dropped on a cell containing another image, the images will swap places.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a basic web server to host the files, or open `index.html` directly in a web browser.

### Installation

    ```

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the project.

### Usage

- Simply drag any image to an empty cell or swap it with another image by dropping it on top of another cell.
